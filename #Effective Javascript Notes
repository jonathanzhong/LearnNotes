#Effective Javascript Notes

- Things to remember
 * JavaScript numbers are double-precision floating-point numbers.
 * Intergers in JS are just a subset of doubles rather than a separate datatype.
 * Bitwise operator treat numbers as if they were 32-bit signed integers.
 * Be aware of limitations of precisions in floating-point arithmetic.
